Project Brief

The aim of this project is to create complex series of LFOs which control the percieved depth of a sound and its placement in the stereo field.

Steps (for now)

	1. Create two simple sine LFOs which controls depth and L/R position of a sound
	2. Apply to multiple tracks in ableton
	3. Apply some hierarchy helps match, in particular, the depth of the sound with the accents of the beat
